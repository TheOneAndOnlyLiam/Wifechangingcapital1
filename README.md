## Accessing the Uniswap Interface

To access the Uniswap Interface, use an IPFS gateway link from the
[latest release](https://github.com/Uniswap/uniswap-interface/releases/latest),
or visit [app.uniswap.org](https://app.uniswap.org).

## Unsupported tokens

Check out `useUnsupportedTokenList()` in [src/state/lists/hooks.ts](./src/state/lists/hooks.ts) for blocking tokens in your instance of the interface.

You can block an entire list of tokens by passing in a tokenlist like [here](./src/constants/lists.ts) or you can block specific tokens by adding them to [unsupported.tokenlist.json](./src/constants/tokenLists/unsupported.tokenlist.json).

This is a forked repository 

in essence I took the uniswap interface then began to add pages such as the dashboard
In this readmefile I will document the pages that contain changed code, and the new additions I have made

1. Slippage settings, I took off the max slippage warning in Transactionsettings.tsx line 126
if you change the parsed numbers their and what it will accept without throwing a warning you can do any
slippage you want. 

2. The DashBoard page. this I integrated where the old Vote() page was. nothing much to say here. all modules and pages associated with that are in the Dashobard folder. Integration is needed on app.tsx, and the old Vote page. 

3. For the Gwei settings I will need to useuniswaps Gasprice feed then construct a slow,med,fast base calculation off that value to display in three boxes.
Then on the Swap.tsx page, and i bet the currencyinput panel I will have to add Gwei as a value to send 
with the swap transaction payload, right now it is not included, it is instead sent to metamask without
then in meta we can optionally set it or just sign. 

For the theme files their are chnages where instead of a background color we loaded an image.
the header file was chnaged to incorporate the logo and take off the dark theme settings. a couple menu items where made inacessible also.
